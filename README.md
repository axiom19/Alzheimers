# Alzheimers
Working with a Bad and highly unbalanced Dataset for Alzheimers Disease detection with 4 classes

<h3>Overview</h3>
This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify MRI images into different stages of Alzheimer's Disease, including Mild Demented, Moderate Demented, Non Demented, and Very Mild Demented. The model is designed to aid in the early detection and progression monitoring of Alzheimer's, leveraging the power of deep learning to analyze complex medical imagery.

<h3>Features</h3>
Data Preprocessing: Scripts to preprocess MRI images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model training.
Model Architecture: A custom-built deep neural network, specifically tailored for high-dimensional image data typical in medical imaging.

<h4>Class Imbalance Handling</h4>: Techniques to handle class imbalance in the dataset, ensuring robust model performance across all stages of Alzheimer's Disease.
